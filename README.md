# Job Hunter - An AI Agent for semi-automated, human-in-the-loop job hunting

Job hunting in 2025 is challenging. With the rise of LLMs and other GenAI tools it has become all too easy for job hunters to send out dozens of applications per day for jobs of all kinds, disrupting the job market for both employers and job hunters alike. For employers, it is increasingly difficult to find suitable candidates in a sea of fabricated applications produced with the help of ChatGPT. For job hunters, it is increasingly difficult to get noticed in the sea of applications, even when perfectly suited to the position. 

This AI agent is targeted at bridging this gap in an ethical way: through semi-automation, the goal is to target the most suitable jobs and automatically generate authentic, tailored CVs for the application. The key word here is *semi*-automation: this is a human-in-the-loop application, where each tailored CV is manually reviewed and submitted (by me, not by the agent itself). Each tailored application is generated based on a hyper-specific prompt which outlines all of my real skills and qualifications - there is no deception or fabrication from the model, its only function is to refine and speed up the job hunting process. In a job market where hundreds of applications are needed for most jobseekers to secure employment, such a tool seems essential.
